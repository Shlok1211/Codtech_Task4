*DESCRIPTION* -
This Java project is a User-Based Recommendation System built using the Apache Mahout library. It demonstrates how to create a basic recommendation engine that suggests items (such as products, movies, or content) to users based on their preferences and the preferences of similar users. The key concept applied here is collaborative filtering, where the system recommends items to a user by analyzing ratings or interactions from other users who have similar tastes.

At the core of this application is Mahout’s GenericUserBasedRecommender, which builds recommendations using a user similarity model and a user neighborhood strategy. The program begins by reading the data from a CSV file (data.csv) using FileDataModel. This file should contain user-item interaction data in the format: userID,itemID,preferenceValue. Each row represents a user’s interaction or rating for a particular item.

To measure how similar users are to one another, the code uses Pearson Correlation Similarity, a statistical method that compares the correlation of user preferences. This similarity is computed using Mahout’s PearsonCorrelationSimilarity class. Once similarity scores are calculated, the system determines which users are closest to the current user using NearestNUserNeighborhood. In this project, it uses the 2 nearest users (N=2) as the neighborhood.

With the similarity model and neighborhood defined, the GenericUserBasedRecommender can now make predictions. The recommender is initialized using the data model, similarity, and neighborhood. It then generates a list of recommended items for a given user. In this example, it generates 2 recommendations for the user with ID 1.

The final output is a list of recommended item IDs along with a score indicating the predicted strength or relevance of the recommendation. The higher the score, the stronger the system believes the user will prefer that item.

This project serves as a great introduction to building recommendation engines using Mahout, which is a powerful and scalable machine learning library. It teaches important concepts like:

Collaborative filtering

User similarity measurement

Recommendation generation

Working with real-world data files

To run this project, you need to ensure that:

The required Mahout libraries and dependencies (like mahout-core, slf4j, and guava) are included in your project’s build path.

The data.csv file is present in the root directory or correct path and contains valid user-item-preference data.

This type of system can be expanded and adapted for various use cases such as movie recommenders, product suggesters in e-commerce, music apps, or even personalized news feeds. Enhancements could include switching to item-based recommendations, incorporating more complex similarity measures, or integrating the recommender into a web application with a user interface.

In summary, this project highlights how a simple yet powerful recommendation engine can be created using Java and Mahout, laying the foundation for more complex and scalable intelligent systems.
